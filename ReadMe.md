# Project Title

## Description

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.js. Here, I am building various projects to strengthen my skills in backend development and create robust applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that allows me to execute JavaScript code server-side.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the creation of server-side applications.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that I am using to store and manage application data.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of Node.js and how to build server-side applications.
- Explore the Express.js framework for creating APIs and web applications.
- Learn how to interact with MongoDB to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- Implement best practices for building scalable and maintainable applications.
